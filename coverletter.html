									<p>Dear Sir/Madam,
										<br><br>
										I am an experienced and versatile designer with a strong background in UX/UI design, driven by a passion for creating user-centered solutions. I am currently permanently employed by Dotcom Software as a Product Designer, where I consistently deliver high-quality design solutions that exceed industry standards. My approach to design is deeply rooted in understanding user needs, ensuring that the products we create are not only functional but also impactful for the end user.
										<br><br>
										My expertise spans the financial, agricultural, and pharmaceutical sectors, where I have had the opportunity to design impactful digital products that balance user needs with business objectives. Currently, I serve as a Design Lead at Dotcom Software, where I am leading the design of a scalable point-of-sale system for the pharmaceutical sector. In my previous role as a Product Designer at Standard Bank, I played a key role in developing OneFarm Grow, an innovative platform that digitizes agricultural value chains and unlocks financial services for smallholder farmers and agribusinesses across Africa. These experiences, including traveling to places such as Uganda to conduct on-the-ground interviews, have significantly enriched my perspective and reinforced the importance of designing not just for aesthetic appeal, but for practical, real-world functionality.
										<br><br>
										I have successfully built a comprehensive component library from scratch, applicable across multiple platforms, including web, iOS, and Android. My role has also involved close collaboration with stakeholders across various countries and industries, allowing me to understand diverse user needs and create effective design solutions. In addition, I have overseen and approved developers' front-end work, ensuring design consistency before deployment. These experiences have proven my ability to manage complex projects, collaborate effectively with diverse teams, and maintain the highest standards in design execution.
										<br><br>
										I have a strong foundation in user research, which has been central to my work. Iterating on designs and creating multiple variations is a natural part of refining the user experience, and this is why user testing is critical. We are not designing for ourselves but for the end user who will interact with the product. From interactions with colleagues and stakeholders, I have consistently found feedback and constructive input invaluable in enhancing my work. My openness to collaboration is a strength I bring to every project, and I am always eager to refine my designs to better serve the user.
										<br><br>
										I view myself as a creative person who is always able to think laterally. My studies and work experience have made me more curious and taught me to question what is generally accepted—to not only adopt a different point of view but to substantiate it and formulate new ways of problem-solving. With my background in both design and development, together with my innate talents, I possess the ability to approach projects holistically—from concept to execution. I believe this will make me a valuable member of any creative team.
										<br><br>
										Despite my creative spirit, I am paradoxically extremely organized and fastidiously neat and tidy. I am full of energy and enthusiasm when working towards achieving my goals, and I extend this to the goals of my workplace. My exposure to various work environments has taught me about the realities and challenges of the commercial world, and I hope to continue learning, refining my skills, and further developing my understanding of what is required in a professional setting.
										<br><br>
										I am confident that my passion for design, commitment to user-centered solutions, and collaborative approach will allow me to contribute meaningfully to any team.
										<br><br>
										Kind regards,
										<br><br>
										Victoria Thompson
