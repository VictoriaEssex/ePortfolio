									<p>Dear Sir/Madam </br>
                                        <br/>
                                        I am currently permanently employed by DVT and am outsourced to one of their client's, Nedbank, to provide design solutions for the banking industry.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        I view myself as being a creative person. I have always been able to think laterally. My studies have made me more curious and taught me to question 
                                        that which is generally accepted - to not only adopt a different point of view, but to substantiate it, and to formulate new ways of problem solving. 
                                        I believe my studies, together with my innate talents, will make me a valuable member of a creative team in any work environment.  
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Despite my rather eccentric spirit, I am, somewhat paradoxically, also extremely organised and fastidiously neat and tidy. 
                                        I am full of energy and enthusiasm when working hard towards achieving my goals. I extend this to the goals of my workplace. 
                                        I believe my current exposure has taught me about the realities and challenges of the workplace. I hope that, through continous hard work, I will have the 
                                        opportunity to continue learning and refine my knowledge, skills and develop further understanding of what is required of me in the commercial world.
