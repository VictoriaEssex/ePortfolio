									<p>Dear Sir/Madam </br>
                                        <br/>
                                        
										I am currently permanently employed by Dotcom Software as a product designer, where I consistently deliver high-quality design solutions that exceed industry standards. My approach to design is deeply rooted in a deep understanding of user needs, ensuring that the products we create are not only functional but also impactful for the end user.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        
                                        My experience, along with having the opportunity to travel to places, such as, Uganda, have significantly enriched my perspective. These opportunities have reinforced the importance of designing not just for aesthetic appeal, but for practical, real-world functionality. I have successfully built a comprehensive component library from scratch, applicable across multiple platforms, including web, iOS, and Android. My role has also involved close collaboration with stakeholders across various countries and industries, allowing me to understand diverse user needs and create effective design solutions. In addition, I have overseen and approved developers' front-end work, ensuring design consistency before deployment to live environments. These experiences have proven my ability to manage complex projects, collaborate effectively with diverse teams, and maintain the highest standards in design execution. With a proven commitment to user-centred design and a collaborative approach, I am confident that I am well-prepared to take on greater responsibilities and continue driving success within any technical team.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        I believe my interpersonal and collaboration skills have enabled me to work effectively in any team environment. As a Product Designer, I understand that you need to be open to constructive criticism, as it is essential to improving the design process. Iterating on designs and creating multiple variations is a natural part of refining the user experience. This is also why user testing is critical—we are not designing for ourselves but for the end user who will interact with the product. From interactions with colleagues, I have consistently found feedback and constructive input to be invaluable in enhancing my work. This openness to collaboration is a strength I bring to every project.
                                        <br/><br/>

                                        I view myself as being a creative person. I have always been able to think laterally. My studies, along with my work experience have made me more curious and taught me to question that which is generally accepted - to not only adopt a different point of view, but to substantiate it, and to formulate new ways of problem solving. With my background in both design and development, together with my innate talents, I possess the ability to look at projects holistically—from concept to execution, which will make me a valuable member of a creative team in any work environment.
                                        <br/><br/>
										Despite my rather eccentric spirit, I am, somewhat paradoxically, also extremely organised and fastidiously neat and tidy. I am full of energy and enthusiasm when working hard towards achieving my goals. I extend this to the goals of my workplace. I believe my current exposure has taught me about the realities and challenges of the workplace. I hope that, through continuous hard work, I will have the opportunity to continue learning and refine my knowledge, skills and develop further understanding of what is required of me in the commercial world.
                                        <br/><br/>
                                        Regards,
                                       <br/><br/>
                                       Victoria Thompson
